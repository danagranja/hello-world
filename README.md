# hello-world

Hey guys!

My name is Dana! I'm a huge foodie, I love anything spicy.
I enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends, we barbecue and watch scary movies.
Traveling is my favorite thing to do, some places I've visited have been Colorado and Las Vegas. 
I am a eco friendly person, from recycling everyday to planting during my free time.
